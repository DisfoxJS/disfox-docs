##### 2026-04-19

### Releases

#### New Disfox Model
We are introducing a **new model for structuring application systems**, called the **Disfox Model**.  
> It is based on a Component-Based Architecture, focusing on reusable and modular components.

#### New Structure: SlashCommands
Slash commands can now be organized in a more structured and modular way.  
We’ve also introduced new concepts like *marks/tags* to improve how commands are defined and managed.

You can check the full documentation for **SlashService Command** and the **Disfox Model** here:

#### Internal Optimizations
Several internal improvements have been made, resulting in better performance and overall efficiency.

#### Official Documentation
Disfox now has its own official documentation website, available at:
